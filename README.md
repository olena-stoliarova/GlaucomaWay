# GlaucomaWay - Quality of Life Monitoring for Glaucoma Patients

## What is glaucoma?
Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision. 
This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye.

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60. 
It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults.

The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is at an advanced stage. 
Because vision loss due to glaucoma can't be recovered, it's important to have regular eye exams, follow treatment prescibed by you doctor and monitor the quality of life.

## What is VF-14 Questionnaire?
The VF-14 was developed by Steinberg et al. It is an index of visual function that was designed to assess patients undergoing cataract surgery. 
Its usefulness has been demonstrated in patients with cataracts, glaucoma, and corneal disease. 
The VF-14 is a valid, reliable, and unidimensional questionnaire for use in a glaucoma patients and those with a risk of glaucoma. 

## What is this project for?
This is a project to record, evaluate and analyze quality of life of patients with glaucoma. 
It is not a medical tool and it cannot be used as a medical advice. 
Its sole purpose is automation of VF-14 result tracking and analysis for medical practitioners or patients who want to monitor their own health.
If you decide to use this tool for any purpose, you fully undertake all the responsibility for any sort of outcomes and possible damage.

## How is personal information stored? Can third parties access my data?
The tool is designed to be hosted on your machine or server. The developer(s) of the tool store no personal information.
Any user of the tool is fully responsible for handling any personal/sensitive information in compliance with any law applicable.

If you are using GlaucomaWay as a patient, you are a sole manager of all your records and should operate using an Admin role.
If you are using GlaucomaWay as a medical practitionner, you should manage the system using an Admin role and create a separate user account for every patient who is going to input their results.

## Features
The project is being developed. Detailed list of features and user guide will be added later.

## How to run
Setup a database. From the project directory run the following command
