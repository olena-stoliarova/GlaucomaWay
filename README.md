# GlaucomaWay - Empowering Glaucoma Patients with Quality of Life Monitoring

## About Glaucoma
Glaucoma encompasses a range of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, a crucial element in maintaining clear vision. Typically, this damage happens due to elevated pressure within the eye.

Glaucoma ranks among the leading causes of blindness in individuals aged 60 and above. Although it can manifest at any age, it predominantly affects older adults. Its insidious progression often conceals noticeable vision changes until the condition reaches an advanced stage. Given that vision loss from glaucoma is irreversible, routine eye examinations, adherence to prescribed treatments, and vigilant quality of life monitoring are imperative.

## Introducing the VF-14 Questionnaire
The VF-14 questionnaire, developed by Steinberg and colleagues, serves as a reliable index for evaluating visual function. Originally designed for patients undergoing cataract surgery, this instrument has demonstrated its utility in assessing the quality of life for individuals affected by conditions like cataracts, glaucoma, and corneal diseases. With its robust validity, reliability, and unidimensional structure, the VF-14 questionnaire is a valuable tool for glaucoma patients and those at risk of the condition.

## Purpose of this Project
GlaucomaWay is dedicated to the meticulous recording, evaluation, and analysis of the quality of life experienced by individuals battling glaucoma. It's essential to clarify that this project does not serve as a medical tool or provide medical advice. Instead, it aims to automate the tracking and analysis of VF-14 questionnaire results, making it a valuable resource for medical practitioners and patients seeking to monitor their eye health.

It's important to note that when deciding to utilize this tool for any purpose, users bear full responsibility for the outcomes and any potential risks.

## Data Privacy and Security
Rest assured, GlaucomaWay prioritizes your data privacy and security. The tool is intended to be hosted on your local machine or a secure server. The developers do not store any personal information. Users are responsible for handling any personal or sensitive data in accordance with applicable laws.

For Patients:
- As a patient, you have complete control over your records and should operate with an Admin role.

For Medical Practitioners:
- Medical practitioners should manage the system using an Admin role and create separate user accounts for patients to input their results securely.
